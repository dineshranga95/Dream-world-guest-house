	<li align="justify">Bentota is a small city located in the Galle District of Sri Lanka. The city is best accessed by bus from Colombo or Galle, as the nearest airport is over two hours away by car.</li> 

<li>Bentota is a coastal city, and the main attraction is arguably Bentota Beach, which offers a beautiful and clean beach with a very clear and calm sea perfect for several days of swimming, diving, snorkeling, or just soaking up the sun. There are several hotels ranging from luxury beach resorts to modest guesthouses, located just steps from the sea. </li>

<li>The Bentota River Safari which goes along Bentota River and lagoon is a popular activity among visitors to this area. The safari takes visitors on a cruise along the river, where you get a chance to see reptiles and other creatures, or enjoy water sports such as jet skiing. Most hotels will help their guests arrange these tours and activities, and planning as early as possible is advised. </li>
